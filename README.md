# FakeNewsV2
FakeNews Detection from generic news dataset
In this work, we download four benchmark datasets on fake news detection and train a transformer model to beat the
benchmark results obtained on these datasets. Later, the trained model is used to run inferences on fake news collected 
from twitter.
See the presentation for more details.
